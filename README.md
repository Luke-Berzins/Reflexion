# Reflexion

Our app focuses on rich visual and audio interactivity, with aims to realize the user's ability to guide themselves into a physical and mental fitness routine, which both challenges and suits their present abilities. 

We hatched this idea to address a problem: many people with a new or long-standing interest in yoga have fewer opportunities to receive instruction. Practising yoga is an interactive process requiring sensory feedback: something YouTube videos can't deliver. We sought to innovate in the online fitness space by creating an app which facilitates an engaging, self-guided yoga practice.
